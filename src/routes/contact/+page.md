## *ring ring* oh, someone's contacting me

If you need to contact me, I have a few options you can use.

- [<i class="fa-brands fa-signal-messenger"></i> @cms.14](https://signal.me/#eu/yzmB2JtCwyRGEoBWk8H6g5vAxcfJ0ZyMiIPDkFm1K9jb6-RfdhRPvLY3v9aLsOEJ) | Signal (regained access to account and username, but currently have signal uninstalled, link is also out of date) <i class="fa-solid fa-lock">
- [<i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i> charco@tuta.io](mailto:charco@tuta.io) | E-mail <i class="fa-solid fa-key"></i>

**<i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> These are secure platforms (except telegram).** If you need to reach out to me regarding sensitive information, You can use most of these methods for your safety.

### OpenPGP and Email

It is best practice to encrypt all emails using OpenPGP. This ensures only the sender and recipient have access to the contents of the encrypted email.

IF you are contacting me via email and you yourself are emailing me from a Tuta Email inbox, you can skip this step as our emails will most likely be e2ee already.

When sending me your encrypting email, you will need my OpenPGP public key. You can obtain it from the following sources:

- [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> /resources/charlie.asc](https://t480.dev/resources/charlie.asc)
- [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=charco%40tuta.io)

If you want further details on how to use OpenPGP, [this is a pretty good guide](https://help.riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp) that goes into much further detail.
