# My website has gotten a bit of a literature overhaul!
Hi everyone, i've now rewritten most of my pages and added/removed things on most of my pages! I hope this makes my whole website more clear i guess? I'm also working on potentially adding like a gallery-ish part to my blog like locket????

## Personal Updates!
I have discontinued Unbound and i am now working on Neuron Workspace and Neuron in general with [Venus!](https://orb.gay) I hope our project wont die before it drops lmfao.....
I have also started learning some math and science and a bit of CS via brilliant which imo is reall really super cool... I have also recently been to Poland where i bought my first 5-port network switch! yippee! i also now use fleet by Jetbrains instead of VS Code, tbh this has a way cooler UI and i can already work here without 27 extensions!!!! (also btw my keyoxide has gotten really out of date so)

# End.
This is the end of my blog post, uhhh insert conclusion or something here, charlie out!
