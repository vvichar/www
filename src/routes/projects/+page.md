## My various projects

I have created a few projects, here they are:

- [<i class="fa-solid fa-cookie-bite"></i> Unbound](https://app.unbnd.net) | A client for the infamous alternative social media platform bluesky, but possibly an app that is it's own social soon....

## Discontinued projects

I have worked on some things in the past, here they are (sorted by discontinuation date):

- [<i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i> petaltech.xyz](https://petaltech.xyz) (Deprecated November 25th 2024) | website for petal Tech
- [<i class="fa-solid fa-firefox"></i> fennec](https://fennec.sharkism.space) (Deprecated November 25th 2024) | a x86 emulator on the web with a custom kernel designed to show you a colored ASCII picture of a fennec.
- [<i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i> readcv](https://readcv.vercel.app) (Deprecated January 19th 2025) | a next.js clone of my read.cv profile, because read.cv is winding down
